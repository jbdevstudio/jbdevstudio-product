        <h2>Installation Types</h2>
        <p>Depending on how close to the bleeding edge you like to be, there are several types of releases available.</p>
        
        <h3>Stable Releases</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.jboss.org/tools/download/stable.html">Stable releases</a> are - as indicated by their name - stable.</p>
        
        <h3>Development Milestones</h3>
		<p>
        	<a href="https://www.jboss.org/tools/download/dev.html">Development builds</a>, released once per milestone and only a few times a year, are fairly stable, but there may be some things which do not yet work. If you would like to try one of these milestones, we'd greatly appreciate the assistance in testing and 
        	<a href="https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JBIDE">reporting of issues in our issue tracker</a>.
        </p>

		<h3>Nightly Builds</h3>
        <p>The 
        	<a href="https://www.jboss.org/tools/download/nightly.html">bleeding edge</a> contains the latest and greatest new features, but nothing is stable or guaranteed - yet. If you're using a Milestone and need a fix, you can update to the latest Nightly, or wait for the next Milestone.
