== Build Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio

Building *Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio* requires Java 8 and Maven 3.

See https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-devdoc/blob/master/building/how_to_build_jbosstools_faq.adoc[JBoss Tools Build FAQ] for Maven configuration and other tips.

To build product features, site, and installers:

    cd jbdevstudio-product; mvn clean verify -DBUILD_ALIAS=GA

To build an RPM, you can then do:

    cd jbdevstudio-product/rpm; ./build.sh -clean -mo "--update" \
      -u "https://devstudio.redhat.com/11/stable/updates/"

Or, to include the update site your built in the above step, try this:

    cd jbdevstudio-product/rpm; ./build.sh -clean \
      -u "https://devstudio.jboss.com/targetplatforms/jbdevstudiotarget/4.60.1.Final/,\
https://devstudio.jboss.com/targetplatforms/jbtcentraltarget/4.60.1.Final-SNAPSHOT/,\
https://devstudio.jboss.com/11/snapshots/builds/jbosstools-discovery.central_master/latest/all/repo/,\
file:///path/to/locally/built/jbdevstudio-product/site/target/repository"

== Install Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio

After a successful build, two or more artifacts are produced:

* installer jar(s)
* update site (also known as a p2 repository)

Installer jar(s) will be produced in `installer/target/` and can be installed with:

    java -jar devstudio-*.jar

An unpacked update site, which can be used to perform an initial install or to install updates to a previous installation, can be found in `site/target/repository/`.

The installer jar can be used as an archived update site. Launch Eclipse or Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio, then select:

  Help > Install New Software... > Add... > Archive... >
    Browse for the Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio installer jar > OK >
      Work with: jar:file:/path/to/devstudio-*-installer-*.jar!/ >
        Install the Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio feature(s) >
          Restart when prompted.

Or, to install the "Bring Your Own Eclipse" category or "Core Features" feature into Eclipse (not as an update to an existing Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio install):

  * `Help > Install` from the generated site in `site/target/repository/` (or the installer jar, as noted above
  * Select the '`Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio (Core Features)`' feature


== Update Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio

To update from one version of Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio on the same stream to another (eg., from Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio 11 to 11.1):

  * `Help > Install` from the generated site in `site/target/repository/` (or the installer jar, as noted above)
  * Uncheck the box for '`Group items by category`'
  * Select the '`Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio (Branded Product)`' feature
