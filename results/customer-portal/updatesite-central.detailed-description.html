This release .zip file can be used to install additional Red Hat CodeReady Studio ${update.site.version} and third-party features available from Red Hat Central into your existing Red Hat CodeReady Studio ${update.site.version} or Eclipse ${eclipse.version} installation. 

The IDE can install these features directly from an online update site but this file provides you with an alternative to the online update site in the case that you want to work offline. 

The release .zip file was built with Eclipse ${eclipse.version} but it should also work with future compatible releases.
