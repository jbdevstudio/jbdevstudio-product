# Building the devstudio RPMs

Run the ./build.sh script to see options. You can run the build against an update site or a collection of previously-downloaded update site zips:

For example, you can build against the latest stable devstudio update site release:

    ./build.sh -clean -u "https://devstudio.redhat.com/11/stable/updates/" -mo "--update"

Or, build against the latest devstudio update site CI build:

    ./build.sh -clean -u "https://devstudio.redhat.com/11/snapshots/updates/" -mo "--no-clean --update"

You can also pass options to the mock process using the -mo flag, such as `--update` or `--no-clean`. See more examples in build.sh.

Once built, there will be a pair of RPMs (one binary RPM, one source SRPM) in `./yum_repo/`.

You can install these by hand with:

    yum install ./yum_repo/rh-eclipse47-devstudio-**.x86_64.rpm

Or, follow the instructions in link:README.html[Install Instructions README] to add a yum.repos.d repo, then enable a repo with a path to the `./yum_repo/` folder where you built the RPMs locally.
